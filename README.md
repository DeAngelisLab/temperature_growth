Gompertz_GrowthCurve_fit.Rmd fits Gompertz growth curves on data of bacterial growth over time.
Ratkowksy_model_fit.Rmd fits the Ratkowsky 1983 model on growth rate over temperature.
MMRT_model_fit.Rmd fits a modified Macromolecular Rate Theory model on growth rate over temperature.
phylogenetic_comparison.Rmd calculates phylogenetic signal and conducts a phylogenetic generalized
least squares test on microbial trait data.
